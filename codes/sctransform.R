# sctransform:
# - A modelling framework for the normalization and variance stabilization of
# molecular count data from scRNA-Seq experiments, diminishing the need for
# heuristic steps including pseudocount addition, log-transformation and improves
# common downstream analytical tasks such as variable gene selection, dimensional
# reduction, and differential gene expression.
